# Gaussian-Edge-Detection

1. Apply Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection technique on the image.

2.Apply Difference of Gaussian edge detection technique on the given image.

3.Apply Gaussian filter of sizes ( 3x3, 5×5, 7×7 ) across the image. Combine the responses of 3×3 and 5×5, save the resulting response.
